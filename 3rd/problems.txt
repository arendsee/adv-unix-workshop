Part Two - sed
==============


# Genbank sequences - 3rd/data/genbank-flastfile.gb

 1. The genbank-flastfile.gb file consists of about 3000 protein records.  Look
    over this file to get a feel for the data structure.

   * How do records begin?
   * What separates one record from the next?
   * What sort of data is preset?



 2. Replace author Morden,C.W with Batman 



 3. a) Use sed to print all the ORGANISM lines



    b) delete the 'ORGANISM' string to get a list of species



    c) pipe this through uniq to get a list of possible parasitic plants


 4. a) Use sed to print all SOURCE lines (but not DBSOURCE)



    b) pipe this through uniq (and don't get distracted by the biology)


 
 5. Extract the full record for XP_762687



# Fasta sequences - a little redundant, maybe just keep one or two?

 6. Extract the gi numbers from all the headers in the seqs folder to a new file
    named gi-lists.txt



 7. Make a two column, tab delimited file containing gi and ref ids (from the
    '>gi|11466974|ref|NP_054374.1|' part of each header). Write this to
    'gi-ref-map.tsv' (tsv means tab-separated-values file).
