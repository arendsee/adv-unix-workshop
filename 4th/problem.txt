Part Three - awk
================

# Column operations on a blast file

The blast.tab file contains the following columns

    1.  qseqid   - query identifier
    2.  sgi      - subject identifier
    3.  evalue   - similar to p-value
    4.  bitscore - hit score
    5.  sstart   - start of subject alignment
    6.  send     - end of subject alignment
    7.  qstart   - start of query alignment
    8.  qend     - end of query alignment
    9.  gaps     - number of gaps in alignment
    10. length   - alignment length



 1. Print the rows where
    a) evalue < 1e-6



    b) evalue < 1e-6 AND (length - gaps) / qlen > 0.5



 2. For each query/subject pair, print the best match (the one with the lowest evalue)



# Domains file - predicted protein domains

    1. target    - the domain name
    2. accession - the domain id
    3. query     - name of query id (putative parasite)
    4. evalue    - similar to p-value
    5. desc      - description of the domain

 3. Extract queries where the description contains the word 'photosystem'
    and the evalue is less than 1e-3.



 4. Which files in the 2nd_seq folder (the putative parasitic plants), do not
    have any of these genes?

    Hint: grep with -f option along with command substitution



 5. Print the first header (the first line) in each file.
    If you want you can clean up the output with grep
