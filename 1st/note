Part One - describing thousands of files
========================================

For each question, record your answer (the command) in a file


 1. Unzip the data file (called orgranell-genomes.zip). Explore the folder.



 2. Find the files that are NOT genome files (do not have a .fasta extension).

    Hint: try piping output of ls into grep



 3. Count the number of genome files (with .faa extensions) of each type

    --------------------------------------------
    |type                | number of genomes   |
    |--------------------|---------------------|
    |chloroplast         |                     |
    |plant mitochondria  |                     |
    |fungi mitochondria  |                     |
    |animal mitochondria |                     |
    --------------------------------------------

    Hint: Remember to read the README in the mitochondria folder.



 4. Look at the beginning and end of a few of these files to check formatting.



 5. Move all the plant mitochondria to a plant-mitochondria folder and the
    fungi to a fungi-mitochondria folder.



 6.
    a) Figure out how many proteins are in each genome.

       Hint 1: for each protein, there is one header, which begins with '>'.
       Hint 2: can be done with just grep



    b) Which animal has the largest mitochondria? Plant? Fungi? 

       Hint: involves sort and head or tail

 

    c) Count the number of genomes with each number of proteins 



 7. In an act of drunken negligence, you duplicated one of the entries in one
    of the chloroplast genomes (you can't remember which). Find it.



 8. Get a random sample of 20 plant chloroplast genome files.



 9. Fasta headers (the lines starting with '>') contain descriptions of the
    proteins. Find the chloroplast genomes that do not contain the word
    'photosystem'. These may be from parasitic plants which are incapable of
    photosynthesis.

    Hint: checkout grep's options.



 10. How many proteins are in each of the genomes from #9?
 
     Hint: use command substitution
