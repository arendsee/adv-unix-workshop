Part Two - sed
==============



# Genbank sequences

 1. The genbank-flastfile.gb file consists of about 3000 protein records.  Look
    over this file to get a feel for the data structure.

   * How do records begin?
   * What separates one record from the next?
   * What sort of data is preset?

 2. Extract the full record for XP_762687.



 3. Delete all lines between REFERENCE and FEATURES, but keep the FEATURES line.



# Fasta sequences

 4. Extract the gi numbers from all the headers in the seqs folder to a new file
    named gi-lists.txt



 5. Make a two column, tab delimited file containing gi and ref ids (from the
    '>gi|11466974|ref|NP_054374.1|' part of each header). Write this to
    'gi-ref-map.tsv' (tsv means tab-separated-values file).



 6. List all the species represented, write this to species.txt file.



# Domains file

 7. Extract all the unique ref ids in *.domains.tblout.txt that have the word Photosystem in them.



 8. Which files in the seq folder (the putative parasitic plants), do not have any of these genes?

    Hint: grep with -f option along with command substitution



 9. Print the first header (the first line) in each file.

    Hint: try using head with -q option



# Pepstat

 10. Retrieve the full pepstat record for XP_762687



 11. Print the isoelectric point for this record (using sed)
