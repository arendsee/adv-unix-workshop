Part One - describing thousands of files
========================================

For each question, record your answer (the command) in a file


 1. Explore the organelle folder.

    When there are hundreds of files in a folder, try to limit the output to
    your screen with commands like:

    ls | less
    ls | grep [options]
    ls NC_011*


 2. Find the files that are NOT genome files (do not have a .faa extension).

    Hint: try searching output of ls with grep



 3. Count the number of genome files (with .faa extensions) of each type.
    Remember to cat the READMEs that you find. They tell you the naming
    conventions.

    --------------------------------------------
    |type                | number of genomes   |
    |--------------------|---------------------|
    |chloroplast         |                     |
    |plant mitochondria  |                     |
    |fungi mitochondria  |                     |
    |animal mitochondria |                     |
    --------------------------------------------

    Hint: 1) You need to find a way to distinguish between plant, fungi and
             animal from the filenames.
          2) Remember to read the README in the mitochondria folder.



 4. Move all the plant mitochondria to a plant-mitochondria folder and the
    fungi to a fungi-mitochondria folder.



 5.
    a) Count the entries each mitochondrial genome file.

       Hint 1: for each protein, there is one header, which begins with '>'.
       Hint 2: can be done with just grep



    b) Which animal has the largest mitochondria? Plant? Fungi? 

       Hint: involves grep, sort, and either head or tail



 

    c) Count the number of genomes with each number of proteins 

$ <a combintation of grep, sort and uniq, with fancy options>
      4 1
      3 2
      2 3
      4 4
      1 5
      1 6
      2 7
      1 8
      1 9
      4 10
      9 11
    197 12
   3638 13
     84 14
     16 15
      1 16
      1 17
      6 18
      1 20
      1 21
Where the first column is number of genomes and second is number of proteins.


 6. In an act of drunken negligence, you duplicated one of the entries in one
    of the chloroplast genomes (you can't remember which). Find it.



 7. Fasta headers (the lines starting with '>') contain descriptions of the
    proteins. Find the chloroplast genomes that do not contain the word
    'photosystem'. These may be from parasitic plants which are incapable of
    photosynthesis.

    Hint: checkout grep's options.



 8. How many proteins are in each of the genomes from #9?
 
     Hint: use command substitution
