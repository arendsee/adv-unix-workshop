Part One - describing thousands of files
========================================

 For each question, record your answer (the command) in a file


 1. Explore the organelle folder.



 2. Find the files that are NOT genome files (do not have a .faa extension).



 3. Count the number of genome files (with .faa extensions) of each type.
    Remember to cat the READMEs that you find. They tell you the naming
    conventions.

    --------------------------------------------
    |type                | number of genomes   |
    |--------------------|---------------------|
    |chloroplast         |                     |
    |plant mitochondria  |                     |
    |fungi mitochondria  |                     |
    |animal mitochondria |                     |
    --------------------------------------------



 4. Move all the plant mitochondria to a plant-mitochondria folder and the
    fungi to a fungi-mitochondria folder.



 5.
    a) Count the entries each mitochondrial genome file.



    b) Sort output by number of entries



    c) Which animal has the largest mitochondria? Plant? Fungi? 

 

    d) Count the number of genomes with each number of proteins 



 6. In an act of drunken negligence, you duplicated one of the entries in one
    of the chloroplast genomes (you can't remember which). Find it.



 7. Fasta headers (the lines starting with '>') contain descriptions of the
    proteins. Find the chloroplast genomes that do not contain the word
    'photosystem'. These may be from parasitic plants which are incapable of
    photosynthesis.



 8. How many proteins are in each of the genomes from #9?
