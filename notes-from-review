Make three levels, one with nothing, one with hints, and one with solutions


Part 1

    grep:
        -w option

    sort:
        local for capitalization
        include -i

    add extension to 'note'

    tell about tar and bunzip2

    more comics (tar comic from XKCD)

    be more explicit about where the data is

    everything is too difficult, provide needed output, better hints, a good
    cheatsheet

Part 2

    add ? to regex list

    questions should be logically ordered, follow slides

    add a strategy slides
        1) deletion
        2) substitution
        3) extraction from a line - must match EVERYTHING in the line
        4) extraction of record

    substitution ONLY replaces the MATCH

    add a sed logic slide (print by default, one line at a time)

    add example of extracting one word from a line

    anonymous files

    remove redundant questions

    \t and \n doesn't work on mac

    simplify, just do slides 1 to 15, with addititional explanation added.


Part 3
    
    introduce column command

    introduce tr

    Emphasize: no single quotes within a awk script, script MUST be wrapped in
    single quotes, strings must be wrapped in double quotes. Unquoted things
    will be interpreted as variables.

    Have a pitfalls slide

    Have a strategy slide
